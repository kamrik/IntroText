QUESTION 2: MONITOR PIXEL RESOLUTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many pixels in total are there on a monitor with the following resolutions?
a) An old monitor (VGA resolution): 640 pixels wide by 480 pixels high.
b) A recent monitor (FHD resolution): 1920 pixels wide by 1080 pixels high.

Your answers:
a) VGA monitor (640x480): [Insert your answer here]
b) FHD monitor (1920x1080): [Insert your answer here]

================================================================================
QUESTION 3: CHARACTER RECTANGLES IN TEXT MODE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a monitor is in text mode, the screen is divided into a grid of small 
rectangles, where each rectangle is used to display a single text character. 
For example, a screen displaying 24 lines of text with 80 characters per line 
is divided into a grid that is 24 rows tall and 80 columns wide.

Using this information, calculate the pixel size (width and height) of each 
rectangle (i.e., the space occupied by one character) for VGA and FHD 
resolutions:

Your answers:
a) VGA monitor: width =  , height = 
b) FHD monitor: width =  , height = 

================================================================================
BONUS QUESTION 4: HEX COLORS TO DECIMAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In graphics software, colors are often written in hexadecimal. 
For example #E122F2 represents an intense pink. 
In this notation the 6 hex digits represent three components: red, green, and 
blue (RGB).

In the example color #E122F2 the components are:
Red:  0xE1
Green: 0x22
Blue: 0xF2

Convert each of these components to decimal (feel free to use any tools).

Your answer:
Red in decimal: [Insert your answer here]
Green in decimal: [Insert your answer here]
Blue in decimal: [Insert your answer here]

Compare your results to the numbers in the color picker at:

Why we use 2 hexadecimal digits per channel and assume 3 are unnecessary?
