### Introduction to Command Line Interfaces (CLI)  
- **History and Evolution**:   
  - Originated from teletype machines connected to computers.  
  - Commands were typed and printed on paper, later replaced by screens.  
  - Commands are often short due to historical reasons.  
   
### Modern CLI Usage  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Some functionalities are only available via CLI.  
  - Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces.  
  - Easier automation through scripting.  
  - Efficient for remote work with low bandwidth requirements.  
  - Minimal resource usage on computers.  
   
### Basic CLI Commands  
- **Navigation and File Management**:  
  - `ls`: List files in a directory.  
  - `cd`: Change directory.  
  - `pwd`: Print working directory.  
  - `cat`: Display file contents.  
  - `less`: View file contents interactively.  
  - `cp`: Copy files.  
  - `mv`: Move files.  
  - `mkdir`: Create a directory.  
  - `ping`: Test network connectivity.  
   
- **Advanced Commands**:  
  - `grep`: Search text using patterns.  
  - Redirection and piping: Direct output to files or other commands.  
   
### Remote Access and Security  
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**:  
  - Connect to remote computers securely.  
  - Allows command line access to remote systems.  
    
- **File Transfer**:  
  - `scp`: Securely copy files between computers.  
  - `sftp`: Secure file transfer protocol.  
   
### Tools and Utilities  
- **Interactive Tools**:  
  - `htop`: Monitor system processes and resource usage.  
  - `tmux`: Terminal multiplexer for managing multiple sessions.  
   
### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)  
- **Integration**:  
  - Run Linux within Windows for development.  
  - Use Linux tools and commands alongside Windows applications.  
   
### Practical Exercise  
- **Lab Activity**:  
  - Engage with a text-based game using SSH to practice CLI commands.  
  - Navigate through levels by finding passwords using command line skills.  
   
### Additional Resources  
- **Videos and Articles**:  
  - Recommended to watch command line tutorials and read articles for deeper understanding.
