# Home Assignment 2 - SQL part 3


## Submission instructions
Follow the assignment invitation link

In the repo created by GtiHub Classroom modify the `queries.sql` file. It will be auto-graded on each commit.


## Introduction
This exercise is based on an SQLite database. In addition to the two tables we used in the labs it contains another table that is defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rectangles (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    -- top left corner coordinates
    x REAL NOT NULL,
    y REAL NOT NULL,
    width REAL NOT NULL,
    height REAL NOT NULL,
    color TEXT -- color in a format similar to HTML & CSS
); 
```

The `REAL` data type in SQLite is an 8-byte floating point number. For us it means the coordinates and sizes can be any numbers like 3.25 or 7.

In many computer applications, including in HTML & CSS, coordinates of objects on the screen are given from the top left corner.

- Definition and data for the rectangles table can be found in 
  [rectangels.sql](../examples/sql/rectangles.sql)
- The courses and assignments tables are defined, as before, in
  [t177.sql](../examples/sql/t177.sql)
- Documentation for SQLite built-in functions can be found at 
  https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html
- Refer to labs 11 and 12 for examples.

## Step 1 - open the database in sqliteonline.com
Open the practice SQLite database using the link below.
You should see the Courses and Assignments tables in the left panel.

https://sqliteonline.com/#urldb=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamrik/IntroText/refs/heads/main/examples/sql/t177.db

> This DB was initialized using two SQL files - [t177.sql](../examples/sql/t177.sql) and [rectangles.sql](../examples/sql/rectangles.sql)


## Step 2 - run some queries to get started
Run each of the following SELECT queries.
To execute the query on sqliteonline.com you can either press `Shift-Enter` on the keyboard or or click the green triangle `â–¶ Run` button at the top of the page.

Observe the results for each query and try to understand it.

```sql
SELECT * FROM rectangles;

SELECT * FROM courses
ORDER BY length(course_name) DESC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT * FROM rectangles
WHERE width = (SELECT min(height) FROM rectangles);

SELECT width*height AS area, width / height AS aspect_ratio, *
FROM rectangles
ORDER BY area ASC;

SELECT * 
FROM assignments a
JOIN courses c
ON a.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE c.lab_time LIKE 'Tue%';

SELECT width > height AS is_tall, count(1)
FROM rectangles
GROUP BY is_tall;

SELECT lower('abcXYZ');

SELECT upper('abcXYZ');

SELECT concat('abc', 'XYZ');

SELECT 'abc' || 'XYZ';  -- shorter way to concatenate strings

SELECT date();

SELECT 'Current time is: ' || time(); -- What time zone is it in?

SELECT datetime();

SELECT timediff('2025-04-16', date());

SELECT unixepoch();

SELECT 1970 + unixepoch() / 60. / 60. / 24. / 365.25;
```


## Questions - write queries for the following tasks

1. **List all the rectangles**  
   - Take a look at the data from the rectangles table.
SELECT id, width FROM rectangles;
1. **How many rectangles are there?**  
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rectangles;
1. **What color is the widest rectangle?** 
SELECT color
FROM rectangles
ORDER BY width DESC
LIMIT 1;
1. **What color is the tallest rectangle?**
SELECT color
FROM rectangles
ORDER BY height DESC
LIMIT 1;
1. **List all rectangles that are wider than they are tall**
   - That is the width is larger than height
SELECT id, width, height
FROM rectangles
WHERE width > height;
1. **Calculate and select area of each rectangle**
   - Area is `width` times `height` (just in case)
   - Use the `AS` keyword to alias the calculated column, name it `area`
SELECT id, width, (width * height) AS area
FROM rectangles;
1. **What color is the largest rectangle?** 
   - Write an SQL query to find the color of the rectangle with the largest area.
SELECT color
FROM rectangles
ORDER BY (width * height) DESC
LIMIT 1;
1. **What color is the rectangle that extends the most to the right?**
   - Hint: the coordinates of the bottom right corner are  
   `x + width, y + height`
SELECT color
FROM rectangles
ORDER BY (x + width) DESC
LIMIT 1;
1. **Find rectangle(s) with NULL color**
   - List all the rectangles with color set to NULL
SELECT id, width, height
FROM rectangles
WHERE color IS NULL;
1. **List all the different colors**
   - Without duplicates
SELECT DISTINCT color
FROM rectangles;
1. **List all the different _named_ colors**
   - Without duplicates
   - Do not include NULL
   - Named colors are colors like `red` as opposed to RGB colors that look like `#abcdef`
   SELECT DISTINCT color
FROM rectangles
WHERE color IS NOT NULL
  AND color NOT LIKE '#%';
1. **List rectangle colors in upper case letters**
   - Like this `RED` or `#FF12B2`
SELECT UPPER(color) AS color_uppercase
FROM rectangles;
1. **What is the course_id of the course with the longest name?**
SELECT course_id
FROM courses
ORDER BY LENGTH(course_name) DESC
LIMIT 1;
1. **How many assignments are there with due dates in 2024?**
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM assignments
WHERE due_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
1. **Concatenate Course ID and name:**  
   - Write a query to list all courses, concatenating the `course_id` and `course_name` fields with a colon and a space between them. Like this:   
   "COMP1151: IT Essentials"
   SELECT CONCAT(course_id, ': ', course_name) AS course_info
   FROM courses;
1. **List courses with Labs on Mondays:**  
   - Write a query to list all courses that have a lab session scheduled on Monday.
   SELECT course_id, course_name
   FROM courses
   WHERE lab_time LIKE 'Mon%';
1. **Assignments due before specific date:**  
   - Write a query to list all assignments with a due date before January 1st, 2025.  
   SELECT *
   FROM assignments
   WHERE due_date < '2025-01-01';
1. **How many assignments are there for each course:**  
   - Write a query to count the number of assignments for each course.  
   Hint: `GROUP BY`
SELECT course_id, COUNT(*) AS assignment_count
FROM assignments
GROUP BY course_id;
1. **List all assignments for courses that ran in semester `2024-3`**  
   - Write a query that lists all assignments belonging to courses where the semester is set to `2024-3` (fall 2024)
SELECT a.*
FROM assignments a
JOIN courses c ON a.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE c.semester = '2024-3';
1. **Show the red component of all the RGB colors**
   - List all the rectangles with RGB colors (those that look like `#abcdef`) and create another column showing only the red component of the color.
   - The red component is the first 2 digits after the `#`. For example, for the color `#a2cb89` the red component is `a2`.

SELECT color, SUBSTRING(color, 2, 2) AS red_component
FROM rectangles
WHERE color LIKE '#%';
